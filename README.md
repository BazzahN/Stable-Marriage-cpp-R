# Stable-Marriage-cpp-R
This repository contains my answers for Task 1,2,3 and 4 for coding Assignment 3 for STOR601.

## Task 1 & 2

I've decided to combine my answer for these two tasks as I have created the package which exposes an implementation of the fundamental algorithm from R to C++ (Task 1), and I have hosted said package **stablepackage** on github. It can be found [here](https://github.com/BazzahN/stablepackage)

## Task 3

My discussion on the 5Rs for my previous codes and the **R package** can be found in the **Jupyter Notebook** file marked Task 3.

## Task 4
The error code and pertubation code can be found in the [https://github.com/BazzahN/stablepackage/blob/main/R/functions.R](https://github.com/BazzahN/stablepackage/blob/main/R/functions.R). The example code can be found in the file here.
